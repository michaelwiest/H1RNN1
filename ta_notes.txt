Use fake padding for kernal
kernal size below 9 (start with 3 or 5)

Scoring pt based on all the other points is a good sanity check

Input whole sequence into CNN; take that output and sequence and input into LSTM
(image captioning)

Do exploratory analyses to see how to pick and structure a model
- i.e. percentage of how many from one model go to next

Append a number into the vector to indicate how far off the training data is from
the actual prediction
- It will be able to learn which is more important and which is less important
